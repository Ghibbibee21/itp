# Ghibbi Moure Scratch Assignment "AKA Crab Time"

## Controls
Left Arrow = Move left
Right Arrow = Move right
Spacebar = Jump

## Documentation/Reflection
For this assignment, I was mainly going along with what came to mind (along with just weird inside jokes I guess) and just ended up with a very bare bones game called crab time. 
To get the movements to work, I essentally looked at the demo supplied for the class and looked at the coding for moving left and right, which was to put "When <insert key here> is press move x by <insert value here>". As for the jumping, I just ended up following a tutorial I found on google, I know it's not the best method but it worked in my case. Here's the tutorial in question, https://www.create-learn.us/blog/how-to-make-a-sprite-jump-in-scratch/#:~:text=Create%20a%20%E2%80%9CY%20Velocity%E2%80%9D%20Variable&text=So%20we%20want%20to%20associate,need%20to%20be%20jumped%20over. 
After figuring out the jumping and moving mechanics, the rest was just guess work.
