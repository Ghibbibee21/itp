# Pyramids and FizzBuzz!
NOTE: THE FINAL FILES ARE THE .PY FILES. THE DOCUMENT VERSIONS I LEFT THERE BECAUSE IT HAS MOST OF THE DEVELOPMENT HISTORY THAT IS VISIBLE VIA VSCODE I THINK.
## Pyramid
- This part started off pretty easy, I just looked at the range code that was in the class readme and went from there.
- I also went through the readme to get the inputting mechanism going.
- The tricky part was finding out how to make the thing to deny function if a value was over 8 or under 1.
- I asked the professor first and I was told a function was missing, so I spent the week trying to figure out which function it was.
- I then texted a classmate who was more proficient at coding than me at like nightime to see any errors that was missing for both this and and the fizzbuzz bit.
- Turns out I just needed to indent the thing and it just happened to work.
- Prior to said realization, I was originally work around the error where the prompt gave up and gave you the improper input result begrudgingly after 3 tries.
- However, after the realization, I kept the 3 try system but the prompt now tells me to go kick rocks on the 3rd try.
## FizzBuzz
- This one also started off pretty easy.
- I used the same readme but this time it was a lot more tricky than the barebones function.
- At first I was getting nothing but then I added the print(index) bit at the end and I was getting somewhere at least.
- Then came the problem of the fizzbuzzes.
- At first that bit was straight up not working.
- That was when I reached out to my classmate Neil for help and I looked at his code for a second and turns out I needed to add the == 0 after each index % x bit.
- Finally there was the combined fizzbuzz part.
- It took me until 1 AM on a Wednesday to figure out that I just needed to set that bit to the beginning instead of making it the last elif statement.

## IN GENERAL
- This assignment showed me the true pain that is semantic errors (or at least what I think to be semantic errors, idk).

- [Here's](https://github.com/rdwrome/261sp24/blob/main/04ControlFlow/README.md) the readme file in question.
