# Things I learned from the Python reading!

- Chapter 1
- - ## Thing I Didn't know
- - I didn't know that a program is essentially a collection of sequences in order. I just thought they were a lot more complicated due to how much material is usually seen and how computers aren't smart so things have to be very specific.
- - ## Thing I already knew
- - I already knew that Python utilizes a lot of formal language and as a result has a lot of strict syntax rules.
