# Things I learned from the Python reading!

- Chapter 1
- - ## Thing I Didn't know
- - I didn't know that a program is essentially a collection of sequences in order. I just thought they were a lot more complicated due to how much material is usually seen and how computers aren't smart so things have to be very specific.
- - ## Thing I already knew
- - I already knew that Python utilizes a lot of formal language and as a result has a lot of strict syntax rules.

- Chapter 3
- - ## Thing I Didn't know
- - I didn't know that you can somewhat make your own functions. It does require a lot of functions to make it but I thought that was cool.
- - ## Thing I already knew
- - I knew that Python already has its own set of functions. After seeing the whole section about adding new sections, they are basically just the building blocks of programming in Python.

- Chapter 5
- - ## Thing I Didn't know
- - I didn't know there were so many ways to make boolean statements such as nesting them, chaining them, etc.
- - ## Thing I already knew
- - Already knew about boolean statements in Python like if;else, etc.

- Chapter 10
- - ## Thing I Didn't know
- - The entire concept of lists, very mind boggling.
- - ## Think I already knew
- - Lists are similar to strings.
