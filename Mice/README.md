# Three Blind Mice!
For this assignment I was tasked to recreate a staggered and spaced out looking version of the phrase (3 blind mice).
For the structure, I just looked at the example on the readme in the "variables&operators" folder, replicated it, and modified it by omitting the "col" and replacing some of them with 3 blind mice.
Originally, that's all I did but then I found out the 3 has to be a calculation.
So I tried different things such as the basic (1 * 3) but that didn't work so I basically just looked at the references for the fstring function things and tried different variants until I found out that I was doing it wrong and found that it was just f"(<insert equation here>).
Afterwards it was smooth sailing from there.
The equation I landed on was 1 + 1 + 1.
